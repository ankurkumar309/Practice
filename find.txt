My-Findings till now
1. For sklearn related models code got created
2. For h2o models:
		a. For Tree based h2o models code got created for shap value calculation (code will work on h2o version 3.32.1.2)
		b. For Non-Tree based h2o models (code will work on h2o version 3.32.1.2)- code got created and will work if dataset has only numeric variable.
		b. h2o version mismatch issue (if we train any model in 'x' version we need to load and use it in same 'x' version of h2o)
		c. resolving version mismatch issue for a single model - we will download a specific version of h2o inside the model project folder and we will 
		   import it locally. (This approach will not work in production for min kpi coz we are buiding one for all models)
		d. I connected with prashanth, He also mentioned the issue is common in h2o models, He sugested to test the after converting the models into 
		   MOJO file.
		e. I tested after creating a mojo file in version 3.32.1.2 and loading it into version 3.24.0.4. It didn't worked.

3. Issue that needs to be looked into:
		a. version mismatch thing
		b. Non-tree based h2o models - if data contains non-numeric and numeric both data.
